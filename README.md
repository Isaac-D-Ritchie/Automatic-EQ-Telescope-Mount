# Automatic EQ Telescope Mount

## Repository Description
This project aims to create code that can be used to retrofit an automatic equatorial telescope positioning system onto an existing manual equatorial mount.

**This project is a personal challenge I have given myself to improve my coding skills during my first year at university.**

## Loose Project Plan
- Start with the EQ mount oriented toward Polaris (the North Star)
- Import API data for an astronomy tracker
- Input latitude for mount setup
- Find the best way to communicate Python code with electronic components (motors)
- Design a UI (planning to use an LCD screen)
- Design a retrofitted mount for electronic components (3D-printed custom design)

## Project Extras
- Weather data integration (cloud cover)
- Active tracking for stacked photos
- Automated North Star alignment
- Integrate a live feed for active positioning feedback
