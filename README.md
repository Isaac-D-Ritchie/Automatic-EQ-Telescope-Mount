# ASTEPS - Astronomical Equatorial Positioning System


## Repository Description
This project aims to create code that can be used to retrofit an automatic equatorial telescope positioning system onto an existing manual equatorial mount.

 ASTEPS is a person portfolio project where I will be combining my electrical, engineering, and Python programming skills to create an automated telescope positioning system which can be retrofitted to a manual equatorial telescope mount.

- This will be a designed as a personal astrophotography and observation tool based on my 135mm diameter, 800mm (f/5.9) Telescope with a manual equatorial telescope.

**This project is a personal challenge I have given myself to improve my coding skills during my first year at university.**

## Loose Project Plan
- Create safe input functions handling errors
- Import data for an astronomy tracker (astropy)
- Get telescope location
- Get target location
- Find way to communicate Python code with electronic components (arduino)
- Design a UI (LCD screen)
- Design a retrofitted mount for electronic components (3D-printed custom design)
- Handle errors

## Project Extras
- Weather data integration (cloud cover)
- Active tracking for stacked photos
- Automated North Star alignment
- Integrate a live feed for active positioning feedback
